**REMEMBER**: This is a **mod**. This is not the vanilla game and should be treated as a **modification**. This is not and probably will never be official, so don't get confused.

# Features

 - **New Input System**
	 - An improved input system, similar to Quaver or Etterna, with less delays, less dropped inputs and other improvements.
 - **More information during gameplay**
	 - While you're playing, we show you information about how you're doing, such as your accuracy, combo break count, notes per second, and your grade/rating.
 - **Customizable keybinds**
	 - Instead of being forced to use WASD and the arrow keys, you can customize the keybinds to any keys you want!
 - **Replays** (in beta)
	 - Have you ever gotten a crazy score but didn't record? The replay system solves that: it automatically saves a "replay" of your gameplay every time you complete a song, which you can play back inside of the game. 
	 - Replays just store information about what you're doing, they don't actually record the screen -- so they take up way less space on your disk than videos.
 - **Audio offset**
	 - If your headphones are delayed, you can set an offset in the options menu to line the game up with the delay and play with synced audio like intended.

# Building Friday Night Funkin': Kade Engine

**Please note** that these instructions are for compiling/building the game. If you just want to play Kade Engine, **play in your browser or download a build instead**: **[play in browser](https://funkin.puyo.xyz) ⋅ [latest stable release](https://github.com/KadeDev/Kade-Engine/releases/latest) ⋅ [latest development build (windows)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/KadeDev/kade-engine-windows/build/artifacts) ⋅ [latest development build (macOS)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/daniel11420/kade-engine-macos/build/artifacts) ⋅ [latest development build (linux)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/daniel11420/kade-engine-linux/build/artifacts)**. If you want to build the game yourself, continue reading.

**Also note**: you should be familiar with the commandline. If not, read this [quick guide by ninjamuffin](https://ninjamuffin99.newgrounds.com/news/post/1090480).

**Also also note**: To build for *Windows*, you need to be on *Windows*. To build for *Linux*, you need to be on *Linux*. Same goes for macOS. You can build for html5/browsers on any platform.

## Dependencies
 1. [Install Haxe 4.1.5](https://haxe.org/download/version/4.1.5/). You should use 4.1.5 instead of the latest version because the latest version has some problems with Friday Night Funkin': Kade Engine.
 2. After installing Haxe, [Install HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/install-haxeflixel/).
 3. Install `git`.
	 - Windows: install from the [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/downloads) website.
	 - Linux: install the `git` package: `sudo apt install git` (ubuntu), `sudo pacman -S git` (arch), etc... (you probably already have it)
 4. Install and set up the necessary libraries:
	 - `haxelib install lime 7.9.0`
	 - `haxelib install openfl`
	 - `haxelib install flixel`
	 - `haxelib run lime setup`
	 - `haxelib run lime setup flixel`
	 - `haxelib install flixel-tools`
	 - `haxelib run flixel-tools setup`
	 - `haxelib install flixel-addons`
	 - `haxelib install flixel-ui`
	 - `haxelib install hscript`
	 - `haxelib install newgrounds`
	 - `haxelib install linc_luajit`
	 - `haxelib git faxe https://github.com/uhrobots/faxe`
	 - `haxelib git polymod https://github.com/larsiusprime/polymod.git`
	 - `haxelib git discord_rpc https://github.com/Aidan63/linc_discord-rpc`
	 - `haxelib install actuate`
	 - `haxelib git extension-webm https://github.com/KadeDev/extension-webm`
	 - `lime rebuild extension-webm windows`

### Windows-only dependencies (only for building *to* Windows. Building html5 on Windows does not require this)
If you are planning to build for Windows, you also need to install **Visual Studio 2019**. While installing it, *don't click on any of the options to install workloads*. Instead, go to the **individual components** tab and choose the following:

-   MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools
-   Windows SDK (10.0.17763.0)
-   C++ Profiling tools
-   C++ CMake tools for windows
-   C++ ATL for v142 build tools (x86 & x64)
-   C++ MFC for v142 build tools (x86 & x64)
-   C++/CLI support for v142 build tools (14.21)
-   C++ Modules for v142 build tools (x64/x86)
-   Clang Compiler for Windows
-   Windows 10 SDK (10.0.17134.0)
-   Windows 10 SDK (10.0.16299.0)
-   MSVC v141 - VS 2017 C++ x64/x86 build tools
-   MSVC v140 - VS 2015 C++ build tools (v14.00)

This will install about 22 GB of crap, but is necessary to build for Windows.

### macOS-only dependencies (these are required for building on macOS at all, including html5.)
If you are running macOS, you'll need to install Xcode. You can download it from the macOS App Store or from the [Xcode website](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

If you get an error telling you that you need a newer macOS version, you need to download an older version of Xcode from the [More Software Downloads](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/) section of the Apple Developer website. (You can check which version of Xcode you need for your macOS version on [Wikipedia's comparison table (in the `min macOS to run` column)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xcode#Version_comparison_table).)

## Cloning the repository
Since you already installed `git` in a previous step, we'll use it to clone the repository.
1. `cd` to where you want to store the source code (i.e. `C:\Users\username\Desktop` or `~/Desktop`)
2. `git clone https://github.com/KadeDev/Kade-Engine.git`
3. `cd` into the source code: `cd Kade-Engine`
4. (optional) If you want to build a specific version of Kade Engine, you can use `git checkout` to switch to it (i.e. `git checkout 1.4-KE`) (remember that versions 1.4 and older cannot build to Linux or HTML5)
- You should **not** do this if you are planning to contribute, as you should always be developing on the latest version.

## Building
Finally, we are ready to build.

- Run `lime build <target>`, replacing `<target>` with the platform you want to build to (`windows`, `mac`, `linux`, `html5`) (i.e. `lime build windows`)
- The build will be in `Kade-Engine/export/<target>/bin`, with `<target>` being the target you built to in the previous step. (i.e. `Kade-Engine/export/windows/bin`)
- Only the `bin` folder is necessary to run the game. The other ones in `export/<target>` are not.
